# Sikorsky Challenge Arduino Repository

This project is a gathering of all the code using to perform a simulated helicopter flight using Arduino controllers.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them


* **ClearView RC Flight Simulator** - Download CelarView RC Flight Simulator from [their website](http://rcflightsim.com/).

* **UnoJoy!** - UnoJoy! can be downloaded from [their github repository.](https://github.com/AlanChatham/UnoJoy)

* **FLIP** - FLIP can be downloaded from [its download page.](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/FLIP)

### Installation

Once you have all of the software above downloaded you can continue onto these next steps.

* Run the FLIP Installer exe file.

* Run the UnoJoyDriverInstaller.bat file to make sure that your drivers are up to date.

* Put your arduino in DFU mode by shorting the 2 closest pins to the reset button.

* Run the TurnIntoAJoystick.bat file.

* Unplug and replug your arduino.

* Open ClearView RC Flight Simulator, select settings, and select controller setup.

* Select the arduino from the list of controllers and calibrate the device.
