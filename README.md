# Sikorsky-Module-4
Code (Collection) for the Module 4 Sikorsky Challenge

I'm going to try to do this, it seems doable overall. If the thrust is a pedal i have an idea: push pedal all the way down to zero the rotary encoder // calibrate the mpu6050 and so the mpu6050 calibration affects the thrust? any other ideas though? 
I'm going to work on this this weekend! 

My plan: i'm going to try to get two joysticks working at once and then add in the thrust after. 
I'll also upload the code I used on the arduino on my computer but to get the basic code the unojoy download has the bases of the code I used
